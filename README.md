This project is depricated in favor of [https://github.com/Place1/react-native-gtk/tree/master/packages/react-native-gtk](https://github.com/Place1/react-native-gtk/tree/master/packages/react-native-gtk). You can still contact me if you would like to contribute to [https://github.com/Place1/react-native-gtk](https://github.com/Place1/react-native-gtk). We're working very hard in our free time to make this project a reality.

React Native bridge for Gtk3

Documentation for building a 3rd party React bridge is very sparse. If anyone has
knowledge about this subject or would like to get involved, please contact me.

I'm first going to build the node bindings in a separate repo using FFI. At this point, I'm only planning on supporting GTK3. I'm making my own node bindings because existing bindings are either abandoned or require custom runtime environments. If you would like to help build these bindings, please let me know. Experience with C programming would be very helpful. You can find the node bindings at [node-gtk3](https://github.com/jamrizzi/node-gtk3).

Please &#9733; this repo if you found it useful &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;
